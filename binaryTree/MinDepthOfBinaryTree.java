	/*Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

	Example 1:

	Input:
	            1
	          /   \
	         3     2
	        /
	       4           

	Output: 2

	Explanation:
	Minimum depth is between nodes 1 and 2 since
	minimum depth is defined as  the number of 
	nodes along the shortest path from the root 
	node down to the nearest leaf node.

	Example 2:

	Input:
	             10
	          /     \
	        20       30
	          \        \   
	          40        60 
	                   /
	                  2 

	Output: 3

	Explanation:
	Minimum depth is between nodes 10,20 and 40.*/
