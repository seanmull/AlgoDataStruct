	Example 2:

	Input:
	     1          1
	   /   \      /   \
	  2     3    2     3
	Output: Yes
	Explanation: There are two trees both
	having 3 nodes and 2 edges, both trees
	are identical having the root as 1,
	left child of 1 is 2 and right child
	of 1 is 3.

	 2    3   3    2
	Output: No
	Explanation: There are two trees both
	having 3 nodes and 2 edges, but both
