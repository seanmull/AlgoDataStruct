	/*Given a binary tree, find if it is height balanced or not. 
	A tree is height balanced if difference between heights of left and right subtrees is not more than one for all nodes of tree. 

	A height balanced tree
	        1
	     /     \
	   10      39
	  /
	5

	An unbalanced tree
	        1
	     /    
	   10   
	  /
	5

	Example 1:

	Input:
	      1
	    /
	   2
	    \
	     3 
	Output: 0
	Explanation: The max difference in height
	of left subtree and right subtree is 2,
	which is greater than 1. Hence unbalanced
	Example 2:

	Input:
	       10
	     /   \
	    20   30 
	  /   \
	 40   60
	Output: 1
	Explanation: The max difference in height
	of left subtree and right subtree is 1.
	Hence balanced. */
