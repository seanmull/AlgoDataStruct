# Data_Structures_Algorithms

Repo consist of work from multiple learning platforms such as LeetCode, Upenn Software Development course, and freeCode camp.
Currently working leetCode algorythms for interview preperation.  Section is divided as follows:

In work - List of problems currently in work.

Planned firing order - Current proirity items.

Backlog - All tasks left to do for covering all relevent topics.

In work

Planned firing order

1.Hash Tables
1. Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
1. Do 3 problems
1. Binary Search Tree
1. Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
1. Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.

Data Structures
	Binary Heaps & Priority Queue
	Graphs
	Trie
	
Algorithms
	Heapsort — Sort it in-place to get O(1) space
	Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums) — Implement all three ways
	Permutations
	Subsets
	BFS Graph
	DFS Graph
	Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
	External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
	NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
	Topological Sort
	Detect cycle in an undirected graph
	Detect a cycle in a directed graph
	Count connected components in a graph
	Find strongly connected components in a graph
	Prep work
	Once you are comfortable with the data structures & algorithms above, do the following exercise multiple times (at least 2–3 times) until you can do them with your eyes closed.

To do tasks
	Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS.\
	Memorize time & space complexities for common algorithms. Here’s an interesting website.
	Implement a trie.
	Learn these important bit manipulation tricks.
	
	
Completed tasks
	Arrays
	Strings
	Bit Manipulation & Numbers — difference btw Unsigned vs signed numbers
	Recursion problems
	Quicksort/Mergesort
	Dynammic Array
	Binary search
	Linked Lists

Maybe stuff you want to get back to
	sort colors in one pass
	Search for Rotated Sorted Array (not clear what is expected)
	allConstruct recursion
	allConstruct memoization
	allConstruct tabulation
