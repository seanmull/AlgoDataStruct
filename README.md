<h1> Data Structures & Algorithms </h1>

Repo consist of work from multiple learning platforms such as LeetCode, Upenn Software Development course, and freeCode camp.
Currently working leetCode algorithms for interview preperation.  Section is divided as follows:

* In work - List of problems currently in work.
* Planned firing order - Current proirity items.
* Backlog - All tasks left to do for covering all relevent topics.

<h2> In work </h2>

1. SortStack
1. QueueViaStacks
1. AnimalShelter
1. SimplifyPath    
         
<h2> Planned firing order </h2>

1. Hash Tables
1. Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
1. Do 3 problems
1. Binary Search Tree
1. Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
1. Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.
1. Do 3 problems

<h2> Backlog </h2>

<h3> Data Structures </h3>

1. Binary Heaps & Priority Queue
1. Graphs
1. Trie
	
<h3> Algorithms </h3>

1. Heapsort — Sort it in-place to get O(1) space
1. Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums) — Implement all three ways
1. Permutations
1. Subsets
1. BFS Graph
1. DFS Graph
1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
1. External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
1. NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
1. Topological Sort
1. Detect cycle in an undirected graph
1. Detect a cycle in a directed graph
1. Count connected components in a graph
1. Find strongly connected components in a graph

<h3> To do tasks </h3>

1. Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS.\
1. Memorize time & space complexities for common algorithms. Here’s an interesting website.
1. Implement a trie.
1. Learn these important bit manipulation tricks.
	
	
<h2> Completed tasks </h2>

1. Arrays
1. Strings
1. Bit Manipulation & Numbers — difference btw Unsigned vs signed numbers
1. Recursion problems
1. Quicksort/Mergesort
1. Dynammic Array
1. Binary search
1. Linked Lists
