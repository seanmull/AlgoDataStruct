Dynamic Array
Specification
https://www.javatpoint.com/dynamic-array-in-java

It is an array that can resize itselfs when elements
are added or dropped.

Typical implementation is that it has larger space then
needed to store elements.  Once you try to add an element
past its capacity it would create a larger array then copy
elements into that array.

Removing elements would shift all the elements in between
the one that was removed.  For example, if i removed the third element,
element four and five would be moved to element 3 location.

An dynamic array has the following properties

Linked list
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/
This is for a single linked list
Linked list offers the advantage over an array in that
the size is not fixed.  In arrays you have to create a whole
new chunk of memory everytime you want to make it bigger.
Moving elements into a sorted an array is expensive from
a runtime and memory perspective since it may involve shifting
many elements.
However there are drawbacks.
For one you cannot directly access elements like you can
in arrays.  You need extra memory for pointers.  Its also
not cache friendly since every element is stored in different
parts of memory.

Linked lists consist of the following
Linked list(class)
Head
Nodes (class)
	Data
	Pointer
