public class KFreqElement {
	/*Given a non-empty array of integers, find the top k elements which have the highest frequency in the array. If two numbers have the same frequency then the larger number should be given preference. 

	Example 1:

	Input:
	nums = {1,1,1,2,2,3},
	k = 2
	Output: {1, 2}
	Example 2:

	Input:
	nums = {1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4},
	k = 2
	Output: {3, 2}
	Explanation: Elements 1 and 2 have the
	same frequency ie. 2. Therefore, in this
	case, the answer includes the element 2
	as 2 > 1.*/
