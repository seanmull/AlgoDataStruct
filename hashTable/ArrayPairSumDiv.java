	/*Given an array of integers and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.
	 

	Example 1 :

	Input : arr = [9, 5, 7, 3], k = 6
	Output: True
	Explanation: {(9, 3), (5, 7)} is a 
	possible solution. 9 + 3 = 12 is divisible
	by 6 and 7 + 5 = 12 is also divisible by 6.

	Example 2:

	Input : arr = [2, 4, 1, 3], k = 4
	Output: False
	Explanation: There is no possible solution.*/
